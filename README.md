## TODO

## Fix frozen UI issues.

When initially rendering, the entire UI freezes for a few seconds
and then the chord blocks fall into that page harshly.

When performing an action that causes the chord browser to render
new chords, it causes the UI to freeze for a moment. This means the
select stays stuck open for a second after the section of a key or scaleType,
or when shuffling, the UI freezes for a second or two before the chords are replaced.
