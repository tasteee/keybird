## TODO

## MNake icons for progression chord always render.

Just disable them if no chord is selected. This is because
when you swith from one chord to another, the icons
will pop in and out, causing layout shifts.

## Fix frozen UI issues.

When performing an action that causes the chord browser to render
new chords, it causes the UI to freeze for a moment. This means the
select stays stuck open for a second after the section of a key or scaleType,
or when shuffling, the UI freezes for a second or two before the chords are replaced.
