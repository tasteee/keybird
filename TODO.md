## Intersecting signals.

When the user drags / drops a signs and it either:

1. Completely covers the original signal: just erase the signal.
2. Partially covers one side of the original signal: shorten the signal by startDivisions or endDivisioos.
3. Results in 2 edges of the original sticking out, break the original into 2.
